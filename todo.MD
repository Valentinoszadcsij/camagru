Next work on user feaures:
V.2 User features
• The application should allow a user to sign up by asking at least a valid email
address, an username and a password with at least a minimum level of complexity. <!-- password (complexity) validation -->
• At the end of the registration process, an user should confirm his account via a
unique link sent at the email address fullfiled in the registration form.
<!-- email validation -->
• The user should then be able to connect to your application, using his username and his password. He also should be able to tell the application to send a password reinitialisation mail, if he forget his password. <!-- first need user page settings, then add password reset -->
• The user should be able to disconnect in one click at any time on any page. <!-- logout button works, just add to every page -->
• Once connected, an user should modify his username, mail address or password. <!-- add ability in profile settings to change name and email(for email and password email verification needed) -->
